## Projects

### 1. DataPlay Reviews WordCloud

**Overview:**  
This project focuses on analyzing textual reviews and visualizing word frequencies through various implementations.

#### Workflow:

- **Level 1: Excel Implementation**
  - **Objective:** Use Excel functions and Pivot Tables to compute word frequency counts while removing stopwords.
  - ![TF-IDF Visualization](Assignment_1/data/assets/img/sheet4.jpeg)

- **Level 2: TF-IDF Implementation**
  - **Objective:** Apply TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to weigh the importance of words.
  - **Output:** Enhanced visualization of key terms based on their calculated weights.

### 2. Gender Prediction

**Overview:**  
In this project, I built a predictive model to determine gender from a given dataset. The project involves detailed data exploration, model training, evaluation, and an interactive demonstration.

#### Workflow:

1. **Stratified Data Split**
   - **Task:** Partition the dataset into training and validation sets using stratified sampling.

2. **Pivot Analysis on Training Data**
   - **Task:** Conduct pivot table analysis to explore the distribution and relationships in the training set.

3. **Model Prediction & Accuracy Calculation**
   - **Task:** Train models, generate predictions on both sets, and compute accuracy.

4. **Weighted F1 Score Calculation**
   - **Task:** Calculate the weighted F1 score to evaluate model performance comprehensively.

5. **Enhancement with NaÃ¯ve Bayes**
   - **Task:** Improve the model by implementing a NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifier.
   - ![Model Accuracy](Assignment_2/data/assets/img/plots/models_f1.png)

6. **Interactive Gradio App**
   - **Task:** Develop a Gradio-based web app to demonstrate real-time gender prediction.

### 3. Titanic Dataset

**Overview:**  
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival outcomes. It covers all stages of data science, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

#### Workflow:

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
  - **Task:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize the data.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - **Task:** Analyze trends, correlations, and patterns within the dataset.

- **Feature Engineering**
  - **Task:** Create and transform features to improve model performance.

- **Model Building & Evaluation**
  - **Task:** Implement various predictive models, compare their performance using accuracy and F1 score, and select the best performing model.

### 4. Placement Dashboard

**Overview:**  
For the Placement Dashboard project, I began by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the placement dataset. I then processed and combined data from various sources and created a comprehensive dashboard using Excel. After refining the data visualization and insights in Excel, I advanced the project by developing an interactive dashboard using the Polymer framework. This approach allowed me to enhance interactivity and design, offering a dynamic way to explore key placement metrics.

#### Workflow:

- **Data Processing & EDA in Excel:**
  - Conducted thorough exploratory data analysis on the placement dataset.
  - Cleaned and combined data from multiple sources.
  - Built an initial dashboard in Excel to visualize key metrics such as total students, placement percentage, average CTC, and company-wise placements.
  
  - ![Dashboard using excel](Assignment_4/assets/img/Dashboard_with_excel.jpeg)


- **Interactive Dashboard using Polymer:**
  - Transitioned to Polymer to create a more interactive and responsive dashboard.
  - Integrated modern web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with Polymer components to enhance user experience.
  - Focused on dynamic visualizations and responsive design for better data exploration.
