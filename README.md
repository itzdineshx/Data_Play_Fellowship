## Projects

### 1. DataPlay Reviews WordCloud

**Overview:**  
This project focuses on analyzing textual reviews and visualizing word frequencies through various implementations.

#### Workflow:

- **Level 1: Excel Implementation**
  - **Objective:** Use Excel functions and Pivot Tables to compute word frequency counts while removing stopwords.

- **Level 2: TF-IDF Implementation**
  - **Objective:** Apply TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to weigh the importance of words.
  - **Output:** Enhanced visualization of key terms based on their calculated weights.

### 2. Gender Prediction

**Overview:**  
In this project, I built a predictive model to determine gender from a given dataset. The project involves detailed data exploration, model training, evaluation, and an interactive demonstration.

#### Workflow:

1. **Stratified Data Split**
   - **Task:** Partition the dataset into training and validation sets using stratified sampling. 

2. **Pivot Analysis on Training Data**
   - **Task:** Conduct pivot table analysis to explore the distribution and relationships in the training set.

3. **Model Prediction & Accuracy Calculation**
   - **Task:** Train models, generate predictions on both sets, and compute accuracy.

4. **Weighted F1 Score Calculation**
   - **Task:** Calculate the weighted F1 score to evaluate model performance comprehensively.

5. **Enhancement with NaÃ¯ve Bayes**
   - **Task:** Improve the model by implementing a NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifier.

### 3. Titanic Dataset

**Overview:**  
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival outcomes. It covers all stages of data science, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

#### Workflow:

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
  - **Task:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize the data.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - **Task:** Analyze trends, correlations, and patterns within the dataset.

- **Feature Engineering**
  - **Task:** Create and transform features to improve model performance.

- **Model Building & Evaluation**
  - **Task:** Implement various predictive models, compare their performance using accuracy and F1 score, and select the best performing model.
